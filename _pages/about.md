Our lab takes advantage of advances in single-cell genomics to study minute amounts of nuclei acids outside the context of naturally occurring cells. We aim to characterise the RNA content of biomolecular condensates, extracellular vesicles as well as cell-free RNA/DNA in order to address intriguing questions in medicine & synthetic biology.

We are part of the [Department of RNA Bioinformatics and High-Throughput Sequencing Analysis](https://www.rna.uni-jena.de/){:target="\_blank"} at the University Jena and located at the [Leibniz Institute on Aging (FLI)](https://www.leibniz-fli.de/).
